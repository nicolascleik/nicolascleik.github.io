      "My career is built on the belief that <strong>software quality is non-negotiable</strong>. I advocate for a 'Quality-First' approach, where postponing a release by two days to ensure <span class='highlight'>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</span> and solid architectural patterns is more valuable than delivering fragile code fast.",
      "With a background bridging <strong>Academic Research</strong> and <strong>Technical Leadership</strong>, I specialize in translating complex business requirements (like Churn reduction) into scalable technical solutions. My focus has shifted from merely 'writing code' to <strong>designing resilient systems</strong> capable of evolving without accumulating technical debt."
